Organizations are resistant to change, but it may not be for the reasons you think. When it comes to modernizing an application, navigating corporate bureaucracy is often the largest hurdle. Coordinating across multiple departments can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Dev teams often get stuck in a cycle of “hurry up and wait”.

Most talks about modernization talk about the strangler fig pattern. In this session, we will go beyond strangler fig to discuss how you can leverage technical solutions to subtly but effectively overcome bureaucratic challenges.

By empowering your team to move the ball forward, get things done, and achieve as much progress as possible independently, you will have happier developers and happier stakeholders.
